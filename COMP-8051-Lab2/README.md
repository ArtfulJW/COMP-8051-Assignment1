Name: Jay Wang

To run my Assignment 1, please follow these steps.
1. Upon running my project, you should see, in bold, "COMP 8051", with 8 Labs under it. At the bottom, there should be a button with blue text wit hte words "Assignment 1". Please click it.
2. Upon clicking "Assignment 1" Button at the bottom, the corresponding scene that fulfills the requirements for this Assignment will run.
3. You should now see the corresponding scene.

As reference, I have a checklist of the features that I've completed at the top of Assignment1.swift

Please note I have not implemented the Double Finger Drag Feature to move the Cube around.
